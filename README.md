# DataAnalyzerWarmUp

### Day 01: Added Raw data.
Raw Data includes a signal input pressure, namely CBF, to describe the Cerebral Blood Pressure, which under normal systolic-diastolic pressure values (oscillations of 70-90mmHg), an abrupt increase in pressure occurs at t=100s, and symmetrically at t=200s.

### Day 02: Implemented Smooth Data.
A window frame has been added to detect the systolic and diastolic peaks.
